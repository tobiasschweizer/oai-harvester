This script allows for harvesting of digital repositories using OAI-PMH and includes also the image-paths

For usage information, call the script without any parameters: 

     php get_records_with_urls.php

Call this script on a regular basis providing a datestamp in order to harvest selectively:
The following call of date provides a datestamp 24h and 1m ago (and reduced by one hour according to Greenwich Z)

     date --date="1 days ago 1 hours ago 1 minutes ago" +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"

You can also determine the date of the last harvest by reading its datestamp. For doing that, you can use jshon (available at https://github.com/keenerd/jshon)

    jshon -e datestamp < harvest.json | sed "s/^\([\"']\)\(.*\)\1\$/\2/g"
